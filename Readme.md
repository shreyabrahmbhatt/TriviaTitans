# **Trivia Titans** - SDP5

To develop a multi-cloud serverless online trivia game that allows users to form teams, compete against other

personalized experience by adapting to users' preferences and offering a diverse mix of questions tailored to their interests
and skill levels. Additionally, administrators will have access to analytics tools for monitoring the game's performance and
user engagement, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to improve the overall gaming experience
